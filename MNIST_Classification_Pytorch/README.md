**This project for study Purpose, not efficient results!**

In this project, We use MNIST dataset for Classification Task.

Working with build NN model, training phase , save the model parameters during training.

Using validation accuracy and loss to trace the model during Training.

Implement Early Stopping for efficient training time. 

Assement the model using Confusion matrix, Classfication Report.

Finally saving the model to retrieve it for next usage without declaration the class again.

Thank you. 

Next: 
      1-Improve the readability of the information from learning phase, by showing time elapsed using tqdm

      2- Using Learning rate Scheduling.
      
      3- Using k-fold cross validation, not just 1-fold validation dataset.
      
      3- Fine Tunning Hypereparamters to get efficient Architecture.
