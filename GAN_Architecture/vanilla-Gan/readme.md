The basic architecture of GAN with fully connected nerual networks for Generator and discriminator using MNIST dataset 

The Scripts provides: 
  1- Validation of Generated Images during training.
  
  2- Assessment of The Generator during druning using IS score.
  
  3- Saving the GAN architectures.
  
  4- Visualizing the generated Images.

Future Works: 
  1- Using Learning Scheduler for efficient training. 
  
  2- try different Epochs, Batch sizes, and z dimensions and log results.
  
  3- try different GAN architectures.

Next: DCGAN!
